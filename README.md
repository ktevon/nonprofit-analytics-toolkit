🧰 **Nonprofit Analytics Toolkit**

_An evolving toolkit designed to support data-informed decision-making in the nonprofit sector._

📌 **Overview**

While nonprofit organisations generate rich, complex data, real datasets are often sensitive, inconsistent, or simply unavailable. The **Nonprofit Analytics Toolkit** aims to make exploration easier by providing:

- Synthetic datasets that mimic real-world nonprofit behaviour
- Reproducible code for generating and analysing charity data
- A foundation for modelling, benchmarking, and scenario testing in the nonprofit sector

This repository is in its early stages and will expand over time as new modules, datasets, and analytical workflows are added.

📂 **Current Contents**

**synthetic_charity_data.py**

This script generates the first iteration of a synthetic charity dataset, designed to resemble realistic patterns in nonprofit operations.

It includes logic for modelling features such as:

- Organisational size
- Revenue and fundraising patterns
- Program activity
- Donor behaviour
- Demographic distribution

The dataset is designed to be:

- **Realistic enough** for meaningful analysis
- **Fully synthetic**, containing no sensitive or identifiable information
- **Customisable**, allowing future iterations to incorporate additional features or sector nuances

🎯 **Purpose and Use Cases**

This toolkit supports a range of analyitcs activities commonly encountered in the NFP sector, including:

- Exploratory data analysis for nonprofit organisations
- Benchmarking and performance modelling
- Scenario simulations (e.g., funding shocks, donor churn)
- Machine learning examples using synthetic data
- Reproducible workflows for analysts and students

🚀 **Getting Started**

To generate the synthetic dataset:

  synthetic_charity_data.py

This will produce a CSV (or other output, depending on your script) containing the synthetic charity records.

🛠️ **Roadmap**

Planned enhancements include:

- Additional synthetic datasets (donations, volunteers, programs)
- Data validation and profiling tools
- Example notebooks for analysis and visualisation
- Documentation on methodology and assumptions
- Packaging the toolkit for easier installation

🤝 **Contributing**

Contributions, suggestions, and issue reports are welcome.

As the project matures, contribution guidelines will be added.

If you want, I can help you refine this into a polished final README, or tailor it to a more technical, academic, or playful tone.
